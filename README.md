## 360 Web Gallery
<br>My first project built with A-Frame.
<br> Currently being refactored to be compatible with current versions of Three.js/A-Frame
<br> This project was inspired by a demo project I found while going through the amazing a-frame school [curriculum](https://aframe.io/aframe-school/#/10)!
<br> This project aims to be demonstration of 360 interactive photo gallery that is accessible to all platforms. ðŸ“± ðŸ¥½ ðŸ’»
